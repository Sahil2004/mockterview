- Lack of AI-driven insights on communication, coding approach, and problem-solving  

Mockterview solves this by offering:  
- AI-powered role-specific mock interviews  
- Real-time AI feedback on tone, speech clarity, and technical responses  
- Crypto token (Dolph) rewards for performance-based incentives  
- Decentralized credential verification for tamper-proof interview records  

## Features  
1. AI-Powered Mock Interviews  
   - AI-generated role-specific questions from Firebase based on difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)  
   - AI voice assistant guides users before, during, and after the interview  
   - Live coding environment to solve problems  

2. AI-Driven Personalized Feedback  
   - AI analyzes speech tone, response clarity, confidence, and technical accuracy  
   - AI chatbot asks follow-up questions based on the user's response and code  
   - Detailed performance score and personalized feedback report  

3. Blockchain-Powered Credential Verification  
   - Immutable interview records stored on blockchain  
   - Verifiable reports that users can share with potential employers  

4. Crypto-Based Rewards System  
   - Earn Dolph tokens based on interview performance  
   - Redeem tokens for premium features, resume reviews, or cash rewards  

## Technical Architecture  
Step-by-Step Interview Process  

1. Interview starts  
   - AI fetches a randomized problem from Firebase based on difficulty  
   - User gets five minutes to analyze the problem  

2. AI Voice Assistant Engages  
   - User shares initial thoughts and AI analyzes clarity and logic  
   - If the user has doubts, voice-based AI assistant provides hints  

3. Live Coding and AI Q&A  
   - User writes and submits the solution in the coding editor  
   - AI chatbot generates five custom follow-up questions based on the user‚Äôs response  

4. Real-Time Evaluation  
   - AI evaluates code quality, efficiency, and correctness  
   - AI assesses spoken responses, confidence, and problem-solving skills  

5. Performance Report and Token Rewards  
   - AI generates a detailed feedback report with an overall rating (0-10)  
   - Based on performance, users earn Dolph crypto tokens  

## Blockchain Integration  
1. Decentralized Credential Verification  
   - Purpose: Store interview performance as verifiable credentials on blockchain  
   - Users get tamper-proof proof of performance  
   - Employers can instantly verify interview scores  

2. Smart Contract-Based Rewards System  
   - Purpose: Reward users with Dolph tokens for interview performance  
   - Users earn tokens for completing interviews, improving scores, or mentoring others  
   - Tokens can be used for premium features, AI coaching, or exchanged for cash  
   - Ethereum and Polygon smart contracts ensure secure, automated transactions
